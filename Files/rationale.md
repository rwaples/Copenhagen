## CASE STUDY

*MOTIVATION*

Detecting signatures of natural selection in the genome has the twofold meaning of (i) understanding which adaptive processes shaped genetic variation and (ii) identifying putative functional variants.
In case of humans, biological pathways enriched with selection signatures include pigmentation, immune-system regulation and metabolic processes.
The latter may be related to human adaptation to different diet regimes, depending on local food availability (e.g. the case of lactase persistence in dairy-practicing populations).

EDAR... involved in...
EDAR is classic example of positive selection in East Asians with phenotypic effects.
Recently, GWAS study found EDAR associated to... in Native Americans, with the same causal snp.

*HYPOTHESIS*

Is positive selection on EDAR (SNP) targeting Native American populations too?

If so, is selection acting on the same variant as in East Asians?


*CHALLENGES*
- Admixed population
- Low-depth sequencing data
- ...

*PLAN OF ACTION*

- Retrieve genomic data for 1000 Genomes Project for Africans, Europeans, East Asians and Americans (low-depth)
- Investigate population structure of American samples relating to Europeans and Africans [optional]
- Select individuals with high Native American ancestry [optional]
- Perfom a sliding windows scan based on allele frequency differentiation and nucleotide diversity
- Compute allele frequencies for SNPs of interest in Native Americans, Europeans and Africans [optional]
- Assess statistical significance through simulations
- Test for extended haplotype homozygosity based on high-depth sequencing data
